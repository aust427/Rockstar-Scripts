#Rockstar Halo Finder
#Parallel config file for multi-cpu, multi-snapshot halo finding
#Note that periodic boundary conditions are assumed for NUM_WRITERS > 1.
#See README for details.
#config for L75n910TNG_DM simulation (75 Mpc / h box, 910^3 DM particles)

#Once compiled ("make"), run Rockstar server as
# ./rockstar -c parallel.cfg
#Then launch the reading/analysis tasks with:
# ./rockstar -c auto-rockstar.cfg
#You will have to launch at least NUM_BLOCKS+NUM_WRITERS processes.
